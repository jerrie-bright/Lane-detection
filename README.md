# Lane-detection

Autonomous lane detection for self-driving cars using Hough lines, Masking, Canny filters, and Gaussian filters
Primary libraries used in this project are OpenCv, NumPy, and matplotlib. 
This technology has a lot of real-life applications including self-driving cars to detect lanes accurately and traverse accordingly in real time.

The steps involved in this project are listed below:

Importing the required Libraries
Conversion of RGB to Grayscale
Gaussian Blur
Canny Filters
Masking
Combining Canny filters and masking images
Hough lines
Output image
